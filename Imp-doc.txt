Important Note About Google Maps Key
The next video shows how to hook up Google Maps by generating an API key on the Google Developer's Console.  Creating an API key requires a Google Developer account with billing enabled.  This means you have to have a credit card tied to your Google account.

If you do not have a credit card tied to your Google account, or do not want to add one, then please use this pre-generated API key instead:

You can skip the entire next video.  After the next video, your index.html file should look like this:

<html>
  <body>
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBNLrJhOMz6idD05pzfn5lhA-TAw-mAZCU"></script>
    <script src="./src/index.ts"></script>
  </body>

   Required Update for New @types Library
The @types/googlemaps library that is installed in the next video has been deprecated. Instead, we need to install a different library:

npm install @types/google.maps

Also, you will still see a TS error in your code editor:

Cannot find name 'google'.ts(2304)

As the very first line in the index.ts file, you will need to add a triple slash directive:

/// <reference types="@types/google.maps" />
You can read about this in the official docs here:
