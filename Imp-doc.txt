Important Note About Google Maps Key
The next video shows how to hook up Google Maps by generating an API key on the Google Developer's Console.  Creating an API key requires a Google Developer account with billing enabled.  This means you have to have a credit card tied to your Google account.

If you do not have a credit card tied to your Google account, or do not want to add one, then please use this pre-generated API key instead:
